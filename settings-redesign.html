                I redesigned Market’s settings page, improving the user
                experience and refreshing the appearance. This work helped to
                increase customer satisfaction and strengthen the code
                infrastructure. The solution also became a foundation for the
                follow-up release to boost upselling inside the app.

              businesses. It helps business owners to automate accounting and
              document exchange with controlling authorities. It also provides

              Like many web apps, Market has a settings section. There, users
              can review their personal data and billing information, manage
              third-party service integrations, and set other preferences.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              A few years ago, Market was an emerging service with limited
              functionality, so there wasn’t much to configure — all the
              controls fit inside a small side panel. As the product grew, the
              scope of supported features and connections widened substantially.
              The rise brought along the need for dozens of new settings, which
              felt too much for the modest side panel UI. The overload of
              content made it hard to scan and navigate through:

              Our team, especially the designers, were dissatisfied with how
              confusing and cluttered Settings became. No one ever got around to
              fixing the problem, though — we thought the settings section was
              purely technical and rarely visited by users. Updating the UI was
              expected to require more resources than any measurable profit
              would make up for.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I decided to investigate the case and find the point of interest
              intersection for the users, the business, and the design.

              The controls in the settings panel supported many different parts
              of Market. My idea was to approach product managers across all
              these departments and ask them to open up a little about related
              plans. After that, we brainstormed whether we could move towards
              fulfilling these ambitions by redesigning Settings.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Among all the conversations with the decision-makers, one got
              things moving. The owner of our billing department shared that
              they were looking for a way to boost KPIs in upselling. The
              studies on the subject showed that users rarely purchased add-ons
              from the Market app. One of the reasons was that the app only
              offered additional modules contextually, for example, when users
              attempted to access a feature only available on a higher-tier
              plan. To explore all tariffs and options, the customers had to
              visit the dedicated landing page — which wasn’t easily
              discoverable from the app itself.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Talking about possible solutions, the owner mentioned the concept
              of a page inside Market, where users could see personalised deals
              according to their already-purchased modules and business field.
              At that time, he had been thinking about it for quite a while but
              could not shape a vision of any viable implementation. To me, that
              sounded like a match. I laid out my concerns about the outdated
              settings section and supposed that renewing it might as well
              provide a necessary base for “the Showcase page”.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              We found the notion hopeful but needed some artefacts to proceed.
              I took time to materialise the concept and come back to have it
              evaluated by the team.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="user-research">
            <h2 class="article">User research</h2>
            <p class="pageText article">
              After the talks with the managers, I got a good picture of the new
              Settings. But before making any sketches, I decided to get some
              user feedback to ensure the design would align with customers’
              needs. Together with our UX research team, we did a two-step study
              to understand users’ thoughts on the current Settings, reveal
              usability issues, and collect ideas for improvement.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              The first part of the research was semi-structured interviews,
              which confirmed our team’s assumptions. The participants described
              existing Settings as disorganised and overly complex. They also
              complained about the ambiguous, sometimes insufficient status
              indication. One of the respondents said: “Not too much is clear
              here, so I don’t see this [page] often. If I needed to tweak
              anything, I’d more likely contact the support”. These insights
              highlighted that functionality and simplicity should be a top
              concern during the section redesign.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Secondly, we set up a series of card-sorting sessions. The goal
              was to understand how our users classify settings in Market and
              how they motivate the grouping. In each session, we asked the
              participants to put configurable entities into the predefined
              categories. To reduce bias, we did the testing using several
              slightly different category lists. Here are some of the complete
              mappings:
            </p>
            <div class="articleVisualBlock">
              <div class="visualAligner default">
                <img class="articleImage" src="images/Set/Set-1-img.png" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              The results weren’t straightforward. The users clustered most of
              the entities similarly, which suggested a way to organise the
              corresponding settings in the new UI. At the same time, there were
              some contrasting choices the participants made. As the follow-up
              conversations showed, the approach to the task depended on the
              type of each customer’s business and their working routine. I
              concluded that developing a separate Settings structure for each
              user persona would be impractical. Instead, I focused on building
              a universal, expressive arrangement that would be easy to learn
              and use for all.

            <p class="pageText article">
              At the time, our design team was doing a big cleanup across the
              whole application, refreshing visual style and unifying interface
              patterns. Drafting the global layout of the new Settings, I wanted
              to get some inspiration from the already-compiled and time-tested
              layouts.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I liked the format of Market’s Reports page, where different data
              types show up in separate blocks called “widgets.” The widgets
              display key metrics for quick assessments, and clicking a block
              opens a detailed report:
            </p>
            <div class="articleVisualBlock">
              <div class="visualAligner default">
                <img class="articleImage" src="images/Set/Set-2-img.png" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              The segmented nature of Reports appealed to me: it provided a good
              overview of the diverse page content yet didn’t overwhelm with too
              much info upfront. This modular UI allowed for more precise and
              effective user onboarding than standard linear layouts.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Market had many more settings than report types, so placing all
              preferences on one page didn’t seem very user-friendly. To help
              users better navigate and search for desired settings, I
              introduced sections in a sidebar. Here’s how the draft came out:
            </p>
            <div class="articleVisualBlock">
              <div class="visualAligner default">
                <img class="articleImage" src="images/Set/Set-3-img.png" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              When it came to appearance, I aimed for consistency early on. The
              settings had to be visually coherent both internally and with the
              rest of Market. To achieve this, I planned to create a set of
              reusable components based on our UI kit so that designers and
              developers could make any widget just by stacking those
              components. During the concept phase, I sketched some of those
              blocks and described the order in which they might appear in a
              widget:
            </p>
            <div class="articleVisualBlock">
              <div class="visualAligner default">
                <img class="articleImage" src="images/Set/Set-4-img.png" />
              </div>
            </div>

              Finally, I built the first widgets to get a rough representation
              of Market settings in a reimagined view. It was now time to get
              feedback from the team and the users.

              For the validation, I prepared an interactive prototype. In the
              prototype, one could open the new Settings from the Market's
              Dashboard screen, jump between grouped preferences via the
              sidebar, and change some of them:

              First, during moderated tests, I evaluated the concept with some
              of our most loyal customers. They received the design well.
              However, some users remarked on the unfamiliar naming in the
              sidebar, which made them “click through every subsection to find
              the new locations of known settings”.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I shared this point with fellow designers as I passed them the
              prototype. We agreed that the issue wasn’t critical: regardless of
              the labelling, users would have to explore the interface the first
              time they see it — and we expected to steepen the learning curve
              with an onboarding tour. The discussion with the designers also
              drew my attention to several essential details to polish in the
              final solution.

              Next, I presented the concept to our developers and asked them if
              rebuilding Settings could benefit the code infrastructure. After a
              short code review, the devs pointed out that the task itself would
              be resource-heavy, but the positive impact would become more and
              more prominent over time. With both frontend and backend code
              refactored, Settings and the connected app modules would be much
              easier to support and evolve.

              allocate his resource quota for the development. Planning the
              further work, we settled that the functionality would be shipped
              to users gradually, and the upselling page would only be released
              after the Settings layout updates.

              At first glance, Improving Settings seemed like purely cosmetic
              work. However, the concept phase made it clear that for a quality
              implementation, we had to account for many subtleties,
              dependencies, and user scenarios. That’s why thorough analytic
              documentation was a must.

              requirements. In addition, we collected interaction metrics on the

              Relying on the documentation and user research, I regrouped the
              widgets and optimised the sidebar by making subsection titles more
              concise and removing nesting. I also took away the redundant
              titles on top of a selected section. As a result, the UI became
              lighter and better for intuitive user navigation.

              Thanks to the exhaustive documentation produced earlier, I created
              a kit of block-type UI components that one could use to quickly
              build any setting widget or modify an existing one. Every such
              component is a wrapper over elements from our team’s React
              library, which means the specialised kit is easy to replicate and

              At the time, our design team was switching to selective editing
              all across the Market UI. In this mechanic, a page appears in
              read-only mode by default, while users can independently put its
              parts into edit mode.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              In the early prototypes, whole widgets could toggle between view
              and edit states, and all changes could be saved with a single
              button click. This approach got a fair share of criticism from my
              fellow designers. The main problem was with the complex parameters
              that were not just edited as plain text but had a dedicated
              interface instead. Embedding this UI into widgets seemed tedious
              and could lead to content abruptly jumping when the user goes from
              view to edit mode and back.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              There were other minor issues with the above idea. For example, it
              was unclear how binary settings should behave, as the nature of a
              toggle control entails that the changes take effect immediately
              and do not require confirmation. One more potential drawback had
              to do with displaying uneditable fields — those would have to look
              “disabled” in the edit mode. Implementing this would only waste
              developers' time and make the layout messier.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I reconsidered the editing and made it more granular. Now, users
              can interact with each setting independently by clicking on it.
              Basic settings can be changed on the spot, while more elaborate
              ones open modal windows. If multiple actions are available for a
              setting, they move into a dropdown menu:

              I like the way it works. With selective editing, Settings better
              aid user focus, helping minimise errors and improve performance in

              One of the main flaws of the old Settings was their low
              informativity. The statuses of connections and other
              configurations lacked clarity and, in some cases, were not
              displayed at all. Because of this, users had to spend extra time
              figuring out whether they had set up a particular feature
              correctly or if any action was required.

              In the redesign, I added success badges. They appear in widgets of
              active integrations, allowing users to quickly see what
              functionality is enabled. The on-hover tooltips explicitly convey
              the meaning of the badges:

              Of course, there can also be warnings and errors. These showed up
              inconsistently in the previous interface: it could be a
              vibrantly-coloured text, a single icon, both or none. Now, all
              such states are communicated concisely through compact
              notification blocks — the same ones we use widely across Market.
              If there’s at least one notification in a Settings subsection, the
              marker appears in the sidebar, and the Settings button in the top
              bar fills with colour. This hint guarantees that the user won’t
              miss the alert regardless of what page they are currently on.
              Furthermore, it paves the way for locating and handling errors
              step by step (or click by click, speaking technically):

              Settings are not always opened directly from the Market top bar.
              Sometimes, users get there from other app sections or through the
              quick search field on the Home screen. In these scenarios, the old
              UI was confusing: the side panel just slid into view, exposing all
              available configurations. Users had to go through this long list

              back end. That is why the most significant challenge for our
              feature team was to debate and agree on decisions regarding
              release sequencing, resolving intertask conflicts and dealing with
              code dependencies.

              During testing, I joined our QA engineers to review the in-product
              implementation of Settings. I did a few iterations of inspection
              focusing on appearance and UX mechanics. After every iteration, I
              passed the bugs to the testers and developers for fixes. That
              ultimately made the new section look and behave just like in the
              design.

              By refreshing Settings, we levelled up one of the most essential
              interfaces in Market. The new UI is more organised,
              user-friendly, sustainable, and visually pleasing.

              The task didn’t aim for any short-term money profit, so getting
              users' feedback was crucial to check if we were moving in the
              right direction. I introduced a small banner at the top of the
              released section. Users saw it after they spent some time working
              with settings. One could rate the update on a scale of 1 to 5 and
              optionally write a review:

              Over the first month after the rollout, I collected over 150
              responses. They showed that the redesign was welcomed well —

              Just like after any major product update, there was negative
              feedback, too. Unfortunately, each of the low ratings came with no
              review attached. Together with the researchers, I plan to contact
              the unsatisfied users to ask them about any specific complaints
              and suggestions they might have. If the concerns are rational, I
              will address them as I improve Settings further.

              Upgrading the old Settings was beneficial for the app
              infrastructure. We refactored dated code and reinforced the front
              end with the component-based widget structure. Making routine
              fixes and new functionality is now less costly for both designers
              and developers.

              With the new modular structure and user experience patterns
              involved, Settings are now on their way to becoming more than just
              a utility screen. In further releases, the Billing widget would
              upscale into a customer-tailored page that would encourage
              upselling of Market tariffs and add-ons and increase the revenue.

              I brought the concepts of this ‘showcasing subsection’ to a
              finished look with the help of a fellow designer, Daniil Imgada.
              We improved the layout and made the page more engaging by adding
              illustrations drawn by Daniil and our graphic designer, Polina
              Molchanova.

              As the feature lead, I continue to direct how Settings evolve. I
              indend to keep the global layout clear and consistent — both
              graphically and in terms of interactions. Since the redesigned
              section can now serve marketing needs, it would be vital to set
              the limits. The users have to be able to complete setting
              scenarios effectively and not be frustrated by the ads. There has
              to be a middle ground between the product and the business.
