              Kontur.Kassa is a POS application for retail and catering
              businesses. It helps cashiers and servers to take orders, process
              payments, and register necessary receipts. Kassa receives
              inventory data from

              The development of Kassa for Windows began in 2017. Working on the
              MVP, the team had to compromise on resource limitations and strict
              deadlines, so they cut out or overlooked some parts of the
              implementation.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              One of those aspects was UI adaptivity. Back then, we presumed the
              app to be run only on standard-sized displays and specific
              preconfigured devices, so we only targeted the screen ratios of
              16:10 and 16:9. For quite a long time, it had been just fine. The
              team never received user complaints or had other reasons to move
              the responsive features up in the task queue.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              A few years after the first release of Kassa, our marketing team
              ran a promotion campaign aimed at attracting new audience from
              competitors’ solutions. They found out that the users willing to
              switch were more likely to do so, provided they could keep the
              hardware they were already working on. That hardware included
              displays — which were different from the ones we supported. It
              became clear that poor UI scalability was no longer just a backlog
              record but a restraining factor for business growth.
            </p>

              First, I decided to study the situation to determine how critical
              the expected issues were. I decreased the width of the application
              window and tried to complete the most basic user scenarios. This
              test session revealed many bugs of different severity: some were
              only visual defects, while others badly affected user experience
              or made whole scenarios incompletable:

              All visuals on this page were originally in Russian. I translated

              The abundance of resizing issues inspired me to widen the scope of
              the desired fix. I wanted the solution to eliminate the errors
              locally and introduce universal in-app adaptivity guides. I
              believed that adhering to these rules in design and development
              would boost the coherence and robustness of Kassa’s UI.

              I assumed that the task would be costly in development. That’s
              why, before committing to it further, I decided to get solid proof
              that the scaling issues were worth fixing. For that, I wanted to
              get the upper bound of users who would benefit from the solution,
              counting the potential app adopters interviewed during the promo
              campaign and our then-present users. The former was easy to obtain
              — I got the necessary data from our marketing team. The latter was
              a bit more tricky.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Firstly, I reached out to our customer support to see if there
              were any inquiries related to corrupt UI. Surprisingly, we found
              very few of them. That could have stopped the research, but I had
              to dig deeper. With the help of our analysts and developers, I
              collected the effective resolutions of displays that our users
              worked on:

            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              After doing some math on these data and clustering the dimensions
              by screen ratio, I calculated the share of the existing Kassa
              users likely affected by UI adaptivity bugs.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Gluing together all the gathered info gave me quite a figure.
              Making the app responsive would improve the usability experience
              for about 24% of our Windows users. This strong point helped me
              pitch the idea to the stakeholders — I got the green light to move
              on and elaborate on the solution.

            <h3 class="article">Menu screens</h3>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Kassa’s menu is like a cashier’s back office. Its starting point
              is the Shift summary screen, a dashboard with key sales insights
              and easy access to the often-used features.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              The main adaptivity problem here was with the quick actions panel.
              Its fixed width made the actions overlap with the shift statistics
              on narrow screens, making the summary illegible:
            </p>
            <div class="articleVisualBlock">
              <div class="visualAligner default">
                <img class="articleImage" src="images/Res/Res-3-img.png" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I aimed to keep the shift stats readable regardless of the screen
              width. I also wanted the quick actions to always be available
              without scrolling for fast user workflows.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              As a solution, I suggested displaying action shortcuts differently
              depending on the window width. If there’s enough space, the items
              show up the regular way — in a block. Otherwise, the actions
              appear as buttons. To save precious vertical room, the buttons
              only take up one row. If some actions can’t fit in, they hide
              inside the “More” dropdown. The order in which the actions are
              hidden correlates with how popular each one is — I obtained this
              data from our analysts. Here’s what it looks like:

              Under the other menu sections, there’s more detailed info about
              receipts, sold items, and cash operations. There are many tables
              and lists, so the issues were mostly wrong formatting and text
              truncation.

              The fixes were straightforward. I depicted the desired behaviour

              As seen from the two demos above, I also worked on the global
              layout. I defined the percentage rule for how the menu and the
              content share the screen and specified the containers’ min-width
              values. With these tweaks, the window area is used more
              effectively, and the UI looks balanced on both wide and compact
              monitors.

              The Fill-up screen is the most critical piece of UI in Kassa —
              every sale starts here. Cashiers can add items to the cart and
              modify and delete entities. The added items are on the left, while
              the right side has the search bar and the tiles for quickly adding
              popular goods.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I identified two major flaws in this interface. The first one was
              the broken resizing behaviour of the cart panel. Strangely enough,
              the width of this layout depended on the window height. That
              caused the item list to either collapse too much or appear overly
              large on non-standard displays. Furthermore, the total amount on
              the primary "To payment" button could get pushed off the frame and
              become invisible to the user:

            <p class="pageText article">
              To make things right, I set the cart panel’s x-size to rely on the
              screen width instead of its height. I also adjusted the cart
              container’s minimum width and improved the primary button to

              Another problem was the inflexible item tiles. Changing the screen
              width made the grid scale as a whole, where each tile could grow
              or shrink infinitely. In these conditions, tiles became
              practically useless on wide monitors: their titles were harder to
              scan, and smaller hitboxes took more effort to aim at:

              The tile grid is a susceptible area UX-wise. Our customers usually
              configure the tiles right after they buy Kassa and set up all the
              hardware. The cashiers get used to the tile arrangement over time,
              so any unexpected changes in the layout can bring discomfort and
              temporarily slow down UI interaction. That is why my concern was
              not only to adapt the tiles to various screen sizes but also to
              minimise the troubling impact on current users.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I assigned each tile min-width and max-width values, which I
              determined empirically based on our users’ display dimensions. The
              length of a tile row stopped being static: Kassa would now try to
              fit in as many as it could within the tile size constraints:

              Every sale ends on the Payment screen. Here, cashiers take
              payments, apply discounts, and print receipts. The interface is
              dense: a right-side menu, a panel in the centre, and a list of
              items on the left. The hardcoded widths of the first two made the
              cart layout squeeze and break as the app window got thinner:

            <p class="pageText article">
              Both the payment menu and the panel hold quite a bit of
              information, which is contextually essential for the user. It
              wasn’t possible to hide any of it without drastic changes to the
              existing design, and rebuilding the layout felt beyond the scope
              of dealing with responsiveness.

              I thought a more manageable way might be not to show the cart on
              compact screens. I assumed that doing so would not hurt user
              experience since the contents of a sale aren’t that relevant at
              the payment stage. To make it certain, I asked our UX researchers
              for help. We conducted a series of interviews, where most
              participants stated they “liked” the item list on the Payment
              screen. However, no one could name a viable reason they still
              needed the cart after fill-up. We agreed that my hypothesis was
              confirmed — even considering possible bias.

              In the adaptivity rules, I mentioned the breakpoint value — if the
              screen width goes below it, the item panel disappears to provide
              extra space for the most crucial UI. I also capped the size of the
              central panel so that the numpad stays ergonomic:

              In this case, the development and the testing intertwined with the
              design and were carried out in parallel. Over the first weeks of
              prototyping, our front-end developers put up the UI mockups on
              Storybook. As the work progressed, I iteratively reviewed how the
              interface behaved on different screen widths, proposed suggestions
              and corrected the guides.

              When we settled all the adaptivity rules, I thoroughly described
              them in the designs. After we shipped the new logic to our users’
              devices, I hosted a presentation for the team to get us all in
              sync. I spoke about the improvements, reflected on the process and
              the outcome, and put forward future possibilities.

              potential adopters became our users. Overall,

              The product became a more appealing solution for businesses that

              We encountered some negative feedback from the continuing users,
              though — there were inquiries on the shortened rows of item tiles.
              We expected these issues, but the reason for the complaints
              surprised us. Most complaining customers had their tiles set up to
              fit into the viewport. The applied adaptivity constraints made the
              tile grid grow vertically and brought up the need for the scroll.
              As we found out later, scrolling delays the workflow, so users try
              to avoid it at any cost. Luckily, tiles in Kassa can be easily
              rearranged and organised into groups. We got the users through the
              process so that their tiles returned to being just a tap away. The
              problem was resolved.

              This situation exposed a remarkable UX insight and highlighted the

              Giving our interfaces stronger scalability resulted in refactoring
              the core app code, making it easier to read and maintain. But more
              notably — we set a higher standard for future development. All
              designs are now prepared in several differently-sized layouts and
              equipped with adaptivity guides. If possible, we try to reuse
              resizing patterns across similar UI elements. Finally, we do
              hands-on testing to monitor the quality of the implementation.

              One of the best designs I later did with adaptivity in mind was
              for the catering features of Kassa.

              We made a list of related design debt to keep upgrading Kassa’s
              existing interfaces. Every quarter, the designers propose the most
              critical tasks from this list for development. The priority of
              each task is calculated based on multiple criteria, such as how
              disturbing the flaw is and how many users are affected.

              I believe that all the work on the scalable UI pays off in the
              long run. It boosts the product’s overall quality, making it more
              accessible and loved by customers. Conforming to adaptivity
              standards would allow Kassa to expand across a broader range of
              devices. Ultimately, it means better sales and higher user
              satisfaction.
