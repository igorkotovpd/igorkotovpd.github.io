# Igor Kotov â‹… Product Designer
I'm a product designer with 4+ years of experience in B2B SaaS. I help businesses grow by building designs that elegantly solve problems, look appealing, and scale flexibly. I strengthen design teams by establishing healthy, transparent communication with non-designers.
