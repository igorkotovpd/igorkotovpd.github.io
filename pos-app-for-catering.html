              Kontur.Kassa is a POS application for retail and catering
              businesses. It helps cashiers and servers to take orders, process
              payments, and register necessary receipts. Kassa receives
              inventory data from

              When I joined the team in 2020, Kassa was just a simple retail
              app. It was initially designed for corner shops, where customers
              would pick up needed goods and pay the cashier at the counter.
              Below is a demo of the main scenario.

              In 2022, in search of growth opportunities, our team started
              investigating the market of public catering — more specifically,
              the software used by servers for their routine. The research
              revealed great potential in making Kassa a new player in the
              field. The product had to be upgraded to a complex POS app to help
              automate accounting, service, and sale operations in cafes,
              bakeries, coffee shops, fast-food places, and other eateries.

              To set the limits for the future solution, our UX researchers
              conducted semi-structured interviews with eateries’ owners and
              staff. I joined to co-host some of the talks and gain insight into
              on-site processes and workers’ relevant concerns. After
              summarising the results, we iteratively collaborated with the
              stakeholders and analysts to form a set of user scenarios to aid
              with the solution:

              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              We compiled three user personas for these scenarios’ most common
              real-life combinations. Each persona aligns with a different
              eatery type:

            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Then, our analysts documented the target scenarios and personas
              into a solid concept with the solution requirements and handed the
              artefacts to me for interface design.

              With the new user flows in question, the app seemed to require a
              brand-new UI. However, my first move was to understand which parts
              of the existing design I could reuse and which I had to create
              from scratch. For that, I compared the catering scenarios against
              the one of an ordinary sale. They all entailed working with cart
              items and taking payment, which hinted that the solution might
              employ some of the present layouts with only specific
              enhancements.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              However, an essential aspect of the catering routine is that
              servers and baristas handle many orders simultaneously. I had to
              address that with an interface that allows them to overview all
              ongoing orders and easily segue between them.

            <h3 class="article">Table orders</h3>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Taking table orders is the most common scenario at eateries.
              Servers multitask and constantly shift focus, bouncing between
              duties: welcoming guests, placing orders, collecting and serving
              food, taking payment, cleaning up, etc. A POS terminal is involved
              in most of these activities, so fast and easy UI interaction is a
              priority.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I started from the routing screen — the entry point for managing
              all table orders. Before doing any design, I reached out online
              for inspiration, looking for present solutions. Some of the
              well-known apps in the industry featured a seating chart that
              showed tables in the UI according to their actual arrangement. I
              found the idea promising, yet resource-heavy in development and
              harmful to practicality and aesthetics. A discussion with
              stakeholders confirmed my foresight: we couldn’t afford the
              approach due to a time shortage.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I began to think of a simpler way to display tables. After a few
              trial-and-error cycles, I opted for a grid view, with each table
              represented as a numbered tile. With explicit ordering and large
              hitbox areas, servers could easily find and access any table. I
              also thought having dropdown menus for quick actions would be a
              good idea: the scenario-demanded features would be close to users’
              reach yet hidden by default for cleaner UI. Here is the concept
              that I ended up with:
            </p>
            <div class="articleVisualBlock">
              <div class="visualAligner default">
                <img class="articleImage" src="images/Cat/Cat-3-img.png" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="pageText article">
              The grid’s final design depended strongly on the rest of the
              catering UI. That’s why I populated the sketches with content and
              made all further refinements gradually as I progressed with other
              parts of the task. While polishing the Table screen visually and
              function-wise, I remembered two essential UX concerns: fast
              on-grid navigation and accessibility. Users had to have no problem
              scanning for needed info and distinguishing between free and
              occupied tables.

              While the grid is perfect for the overview, servers spend most of
              their time working with orders’ contents: adding new items while
              taking an order, editing existing entries, or removing cancelled
              dishes from the list. The interface for these scenarios had to be
              informative and functional yet not overwhelming.

              Luckily, Kassa already had the Cart screen, which made a good
              foundation upon which to build. Fellow designer Alexander Kryazhev
              accompanied me as we turned this UI into Table View. The most
              significant tweak we agreed on was guest tabs. The tabs allow
              servers to swiftly jump between guests’ orders and perform actions
              with each order. The navigation is fast, even with a large number
              of guests. Here’s how it works:

              We loved how guest tabs fit into the cart UI. They worked well
              with the classic mechanics, such as modifying an item or adding to
              an order by tapping a tile. That enabled the screen to support
              asynchronous fill-up — no more changes were needed.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              With payment flows, the story was similar: we knew we could reuse
              the core UI of the Payment screen, but there had to be some smart
              adjustments. The biggest challenge here was how people pay in
              cafes and restaurants: the bill might be shared, and some guests
              might wish to pay or leave before others. We had to let servers
              conveniently take mixed payments and see the orders due.

            <p class="pageText article">
              Our solution was batching — selecting orders to process as a
              single payment. This approach gives users flexibility over what
              orders to charge for and when thus covering the diversity of
              real-life cases. Here’s an example of batching at work:

            <h3 class="article">Takeaway orders</h3>
            <p class="pageText article">
              Ordering takeaway has become more popular over the last decade,
              mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. People favour self-pickup and
              delivery as safer and less time-consuming than eating out.
              However, supporting takeaway is always challenging for cafes and
              restaurants. Firstly, orders aren’t only created on-site — they
              also come from third-party online services. Secondly, eateries
              track the status of each order to keep customers informed and
              measure business pipeline KPIs. Finally, doing delivery means that
              staff should now communicate with couriers — and a good POS
              application has to support that bond on several levels.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              I wanted the design of the overview screen for takeaway orders to
              allow for convenient eye-scanning and provide clear cues about
              whether the user has to do anything for the order to proceed in
              the system. For this purpose, I decided to display orders as a
              list, with key properties available at a glance. I introduced the
              side panel to let servers see detailed info and manage orders.
              Finally, I added search and filter controls so that workers can
              effectively find specific entries. Here’s a demo of the mentioned
              features:

              Predictably, interface recycling came into play in the payment
              stage as well. It was much easier to pull off than for table
              orders: there’s no splitting the bill for takeaway, plus some
              orders come prepaid, so the relative UI is not needed.

            <p class="pageText article">
              Working with either tables or takeaway alone is already fairly
              complicated. Our research showed, however, that a significant part
              of the targeted businesses was practising both formats, setting a
              hopeful trend for all-around catering. Keeping that in mind
              throughout the design phase, I aimed to wrap each of the two main
              scenarios into an independent UI yet place all the available
              functionality at users’ fingertips.
            </p>
            <p class="pageText article">
              To achieve this, I ultimately framed the two overview screens
              within the joint layout, where servers can quickly switch between
              tables and takeaway orders. They can also do classic “retail-like”
              sales — if some guest only asks for a bottle of water or a quick
              snack. Servers can put a sale on hold to handle other orders and
              then return to the sale with the whole cart restored. This
              functionality gives eateries more flexibility in utilising Kassa
              for their scenarios and needs.

              Once the designs were ready, I handed them off to the development
              team. Along with screens and components, I provided extensive
              descriptions of UI behaviour logic, between-screen transitions,
              animation and adaptivity rules. The team — particularly the
              outstaff specialists involved — found those artefacts helpful.
              They also appreciated the reuse of the existing interfaces — it
              substantially cut workday costs.

              After the development was complete and the first test build was
              reviewed by our testing crew, Alexander Kryazhev and I joined the
              process to inspect the implementation for undiscovered visual and
              interaction-related bugs. We found several defects, most of which
              were fixed before the release. We put the remaining ones into the
              backlog.

              Since the debut release, our team has been monitoring user
              feedback. To address the most popular queries, we’ve already
              rolled out several follow-up releases with bug fixes and usability
              improvements, and more are on the way.

              I am happy with the result. The new interface is clean and
              minimalist yet self-explanatory and versatile. It is even easier
              to learn for continuing users as it relies on the basic, familiar
              in-app mechanics. Lastly, the solution is modular and, therefore,
              flexible. That means that any prospective scale-up — adding new
              order types or expanding existing possibilities — would be smooth
              and at lesser production costs.
